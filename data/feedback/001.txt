I would like to raise a concert with the new cheese quotas for junior scientific personnel. They are clearly inadequate. I've been a mouse all my life and have never seen such mean cheese quotas. I urge the management to intervene and set quotas which are in line with the Interplanetary Mouse Society recommended values!
