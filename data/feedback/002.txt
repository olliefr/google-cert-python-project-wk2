The new Orange colour scheme is a delight to look at. It is clearly the best not only in this Universe, but in all possible Universes, that is in the whole Multiverse. I say this as a completely independent observer whose mere fact of observing the magnificence of the Orange colour scheme cannot change the object being observed.
